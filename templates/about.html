        <p class="center">First and foremost, MediaCrush is for users. We respect <strong>user privacy</strong> and
        we are <strong>completely transparent</strong>.</p>
        <p>MediaCrush is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" target="_blank">
        open-source</a>, which means that anyone in the world is allowed to get a copy of our code, modify it, run it on their
        own servers, or offer improvements to this site. As a result, lots of software developers have fiddled with our code
        and sent us improvements and tweaks, making it even better than we could ever make alone. Additionally, since people
        are allowed to run it themselves, there are several alternate versions of MediaCrush out there for those who want to
        have complete control over their media.</p>
        <p>MediaCrush utilizes TLS with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy">perfect forward secrecy</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">Strict Transport Security</a>.

        <p class="center">This site is built with <strong>python, ffmpeg</strong>, and tons more open tech. There's a great
        public API, too.</p>
        <p>Want to hack on MediaCrush from your own code? Maybe you want to build a new <a href="/apps">app</a> based on MediaCrush?
        Well, great, cause we've got a full-blown, free API that does everything you're hoping for. You can browse <a href="/docs">the
        documentation</a> to learn about each endpoint, find an API wrapper, and get directions for help.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps you want to set up your own instance of MediaCrush, on your own servers? You'll need to be a fairly
        experienced Linux sysadmin, but there are detailed instructions for you <a href="https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush">on
        GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>Or best of all, do you want to contribute some code to MediaCrush? That's great, because we love to have extra
        contributions. There are guidelines for contributors
        <a href="https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">on GitHub</a> and we're looking forward
        to seeing what you can come up with. We've got <a href="https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush/issues">a long backlog</a>
        and your help would be great.</p>
